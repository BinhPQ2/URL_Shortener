## C. Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (for frontend)
- Python 3.12.5 or higher installed (for backend)

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the repository

Run the following commands in your terminal

```bash
git https://github.com/BinhPQ2/URL_Shortener.git
cd url-shortener
```

##### 1.1. Frontend Setup (ReactJS)

Open the `frontend/.env` file and change the `REACT_APP_API_URL` to point to your local backend. Change the line:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://url-shorterner-binhpq-f721b6699005.herokuapp.com/api 
```

to 

```
REACT_APP_API_URL = http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```
Next, in your terminal, type:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the React frontend at `http://localhost:3000/`.

##### 1.2. Backend Setup (Django)

Navigate to the backend folder in your terminal and run:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the Django backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
